The Admin Panel plugin has a set of options of its own accessible in the **Plugins** area of the admin. To reach them, simply navigate to **Plugins > Admin Panel** and select the title link for the plugin called **Admin Panel**. This will open a page filled with useful options to help you customize your experience with the Grav Admin.

### Plugin Information

![Grav Admin Options](grav_options2.jpeg)

The top of the Admin Panel options page gives you some information about the Admin Panel plugin. This includes the plugin author, homepage, and license, in addition to other links and information to help you find additional information and report any bugs.

This is a pretty standard feature in any plugin's options page.

### Basics

The **Basics** section of this page gives you a set of options to help you define your experience within the Grav Admin. This includes being able to change the text that appears at the top of the sidebar, create a custom path to the administrator, and more.

We've broken down these options, and what they do, below.
